const PRE_EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a question-boundary annotator. Your job is to take the LaTeX/Markdown content below (produced by an OCR pipeline from a question paper or academic book) and return the SAME content with explicit boundary markers wrapped around each question.

OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT:
- Wrap every question with the exact tokens ${Q_START_MARKER} and ${Q_END_MARKER}.
- ${Q_START_MARKER} goes at the very beginning of each question (before its number/label, if any).
- ${Q_END_MARKER} goes at the very end of each question (after the last choice or last sub-part).
- Do NOT translate, summarize, rewrite, renumber, or "clean up" the content.
- Preserve ALL original characters, LaTeX commands, math delimiters, line breaks, and whitespace EXACTLY as in the input. The only change you make is INSERTING the two markers around each question.
- Content that is NOT a question (chapter headings, section titles like "LONG ANSWERS (LAT)", page numbers, image references, separator lines, blank lines, orphan numbers like "5." or "20." sitting alone on a line) MUST stay where it is, OUTSIDE any marker pair.

WHAT COUNTS AS A QUESTION:
- A complete instruction or interrogative sentence — ends in "?", or starts with verbs like "Find", "Show", "Prove", "How many", "Which", "Determine", "Calculate", "Solve", "If ...".
- A problem scenario followed by sub-parts (i)/(ii)/(iii) or (a)/(b)/(c) is ONE question; the marker pair must enclose the entire scenario plus all sub-parts.
- An MCQ — the question text PLUS all of its (a)/(b)/(c)/(d) choices — is ONE question; the marker pair must enclose the question text and all choices.

WHAT IS NOT A QUESTION:
- A bare number on its own line (e.g. "4.", "5.", "20.") with no question text immediately attached — this is OCR noise. Leave it untouched, outside any marker.
- Section/chapter titles, page headers/footers.
- Image links like ![](https://...).
- "(Example)" labels or other annotations.

NUMBERING IS UNRELIABLE:
- The OCR may place the question number BEFORE the question text, AFTER the question text, on a separate line, or omit it entirely. Do not rely on numbering to identify boundaries — rely on the question content itself.
- Include any visible question label (the digit/number, if present nearby) INSIDE the marker pair, so downstream consumers can still see it.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
\\section*{LONG ANSWERS (LAT)}

If sum of the 3rd and the 8th terms of an AP is 7 and the sum of the 7th and the 14th terms is $-3$, find the 10th term.

Find the sum of the two middle most terms of the AP.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

FINAL RULES:
- Output ONLY the annotated content. No JSON, no code fences, no commentary, no preamble like "Here is the annotated content".
- Every question MUST have exactly one ${Q_START_MARKER} and exactly one ${Q_END_MARKER}.
- Marker pairs MUST NOT overlap or nest.
- Do NOT add markers around non-question content.
- If you are unsure whether something is a question, leave it OUTSIDE the markers.`;

const SOLUTION_PRE_EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a solution-boundary annotator. Your job is to take the LaTeX/Markdown content below (produced by an OCR pipeline from an answer key / solutions document) and return the SAME content with explicit boundary markers wrapped around each individual solution.

OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT:
- Wrap every solution with the exact tokens ${S_START_MARKER} and ${S_END_MARKER}.
- ${S_START_MARKER} goes at the very beginning of each solution (before its question number / answer-key header).
- ${S_END_MARKER} goes at the very end of that solution (immediately before the next solution starts, or at end of document).
- Do NOT translate, summarize, rewrite, renumber, or "clean up" the content.
- Preserve ALL original characters, LaTeX commands, math delimiters, image references, line breaks, and whitespace EXACTLY as in the input. The only change you make is INSERTING the two markers around each solution.
- Content that is NOT part of a solution (chapter/section titles, page headers/footers, separator lines, blank lines between solutions, orphan numbers like "5." or "20." sitting alone with no answer key or working) MUST stay where it is, OUTSIDE any marker pair.

WHAT COUNTS AS A SOLUTION:
- A solution begins with a header line that pairs a question number with an answer key, in formats such as:
    * "8. (D)"            — letter answer in parentheses
    * "12. (B)"
    * "22. (11.00)"       — numerical / integer-type answer
    * "5) C"              — with closing paren
    * "Q3. (a)"           — Q-prefix, lowercase letter
    * "\\section*{8. (D)}" — when the OCR has wrapped the header in a section command
- After the header line, a solution typically contains:
    * An optional image reference (e.g. "![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/...)") — KEEP it inside the marker pair.
    * Worked steps, equations, $\\begin{aligned}...\\end{aligned}$ / $\\begin{gathered}...\\end{gathered}$ blocks, inline math, transitional text ("Therefore", "Hence", "Equation will become"), and a final answer.
- The solution ENDS exactly at the start of the next solution's header (the next "<number>. (<answer>)" pattern). At that point, close ${S_END_MARKER} BEFORE the next header, then open a new ${S_START_MARKER} for the next solution.
- The marker pair must enclose: the header line, any image, AND the entire worked solution body, sub-parts (i)/(ii)/(iii), and final answer line.

WHAT IS NOT A SOLUTION:
- A bare number on its own line (e.g. "4.", "5.", "20.") with NO answer-key parenthetical and no working below it — this is OCR noise. Leave it untouched, outside any marker.
- Section/chapter titles, page headers/footers, watermarks.
- Standalone image links that are not attached to a solution header.
- "(Example)" labels or other annotations that sit between solutions.

NUMBERING IS UNRELIABLE:
- The OCR may misplace, repeat, skip, or omit question numbers and answer keys. Do not rely on numbering to identify boundaries — rely on the "<number>. (<answer>)" header pattern plus the worked content that follows.
- Include any visible question label and answer key INSIDE the marker pair, so downstream consumers can still see them.
