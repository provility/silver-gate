CRITICAL: Extract EVERY SINGLE solution as a SEPARATE JSON object. Each solution must be its own entry in the solutions array.

This document contains solutions for competitive exam questions (JEE, NEET, etc.).

CRITICAL - SOLUTION SEPARATION:
- Each question number (1, 2, 3, ..., 30) is a SEPARATE solution
- NEVER combine multiple solutions into one JSON object
- When you see "8. (D)" or "\\section*{8. (D)}", that is the START of solution 8 and the END of solution 7
- Each worked_solution field contains ONLY the content for THAT specific question
- If you see content like "7. (D) ... content ... 8. (D) ... more content", these are TWO separate solutions, not one

IMPORTANT - HANDLING IMAGES:
- Solutions may contain image references like: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/...)
- EXTRACT the image URL into the "visual_path" field (just the URL, not the markdown)
- CONTINUE extracting all text and math AFTER the image into worked_solution
- Do NOT stop at images - the worked solution continues after them

CRITICAL - PRESERVING LATEX BLOCK ENVIRONMENTS:
Solutions often contain multi-line LaTeX blocks. You MUST preserve them correctly:

CORRECT format for aligned equations:
"$\\begin{aligned} & \\frac{x-x_1}{a_1} = \\frac{y-y_1}{a_2} \\\\ & \\frac{x-x_2}{b_1} = \\frac{y-y_2}{b_2} \\end{aligned}$"

CORRECT format for gathered equations:
"$\\begin{gathered} \\frac{|\\begin{array}{ccc} 8 & 7 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & -3 \\end{array}|}{\\sqrt{12}} \\end{gathered}$"

Rules for LaTeX blocks:
- Keep $\\begin{aligned}...\\end{aligned}$ as ONE complete string - no breaks
- Keep $\\begin{gathered}...\\end{gathered}$ as ONE complete string - no breaks
- Keep $\\begin{array}...\\end{array}$ intact for matrices/determinants
- Do NOT add spaces between $ and \\begin (write "$\\begin" not "$ \\begin")
- Replace internal newlines within math blocks with spaces or \\\\
- Text BETWEEN math blocks (like "is given as") goes on separate line

SOLUTION FORMAT IN DOCUMENT:
- Question number followed by answer: "22. (11.00)" or "12. (B)" or "6. (C)"
- May have an image reference on next line: ![](url)
- Then the FULL worked solution with all math and steps
- Solution continues until the next question number appears

MANDATORY RULE 1 - SOLUTION SEPARATION (MOST IMPORTANT):
- Create ONE JSON object per solution - NEVER combine multiple solutions into one object
- Solution N ENDS when you see "N+1. (X)" pattern (where X is an answer like A, B, C, D, or a number)
- Example: Solution 7's worked_solution ENDS when you see "8. (D)" - do NOT include "8. (D)" or anything after
- Example: Solution 22's worked_solution ENDS when you see "23. (514.00)"
- If your worked_solution for question 7 contains "\\section*{8." or "8. (D)", you made an ERROR
- Each worked_solution must contain ONLY that question's content, NOTHING from subsequent questions
- The document has 30 solutions - you must create exactly 30 separate JSON objects

MANDATORY RULE 2 - COMPLETE CONTENT WITHIN BOUNDARIES:
- EXTRACT image URL from ![](url) into visual_path field, then extract ALL content after it
- Within a solution's boundaries, include EVERYTHING until the next question number
- Do NOT stop at:
  - Image references ![](...)
  - Multiple $\\begin{gathered}...\\end{gathered}$ blocks - include ALL of them
  - Multiple $\\begin{aligned}...\\end{aligned}$ blocks - include ALL of them
  - Blank lines
  - Any math-only lines
  - Transitional phrases like "Equation will become", "Therefore", "Hence"
  - Lines with only inline math like $x^2 - y^2 = 10xy$
- When you see phrases like "Equation will become" or "Therefore", ALL equations that follow MUST be included
- Keep extracting until you see the NEXT question number pattern "^\\d+\\." at line start
- Include determinants, matrices, vectors - preserve ALL LaTeX exactly
- For numerical answers like (11.00), extract "11.00" as the answer_key
- Join multiple lines/blocks with \\n in the worked_solution
- NEVER truncate - include EVERY line until the next question number

CRITICAL - NO PLACEHOLDERS OR ABBREVIATIONS:
- NEVER use "..." or ellipsis as a placeholder for actual content
- NEVER abbreviate formulas - include the COMPLETE expression
- NEVER write \\sqrt{...} - write the ACTUAL content like \\sqrt{(a_2b_3-a_3b_2)^2+...}
- If the document has actual content, you MUST extract it exactly - do not summarize or abbreviate
- Every mathematical expression must be COMPLETE with all terms, not shortened

CRITICAL - SOLUTIONS WITH IMAGES:
- When a solution has an image ![](url), there is ALWAYS content AFTER the image
- The image is usually a diagram - the actual mathematical working is in the TEXT after it
- You MUST extract ALL text and math that appears AFTER the image line
- Example: If you see "6. (D)\\n![](url)\\n$m = -1/2$\\nWhen two lines..." you must include "$m = -1/2$\\nWhen two lines..." in worked_solution
- An EMPTY worked_solution for a solution with an image is WRONG - there is always content to extract
